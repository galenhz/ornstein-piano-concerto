m. 12: Trombone III/Tuba crescendo messes up the score when I try to print it in any way.
Redacted it entirely from the score for now, although it's in the parts. Need to figure
out what's wrong.

m. 28: Piano reduction. Initial rest placement completely wrong. Changed but still needs work.

m. 29: Piano reduction. mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn only half-working.

m. 53: Violin II.  Don't like the g to the left of the f#. Should go other way.

m. 54: Piano reduction. Need to break up obnoxious "c and c#" chord like PR.

m. 55-62: Solo piano. Lower hand is a bit of a mess, needs tweaking.

m. 58: Clarinets have the tuplet bracket missing in score, probably due to colliding
with the Solo text.

m. 68: Go back and patch up cello divisi.

m. 69: Solo piano. Lilypond trying too hard with those quarter rests. Adjust placement?

Fermata bar: add mark to previous bar and hack it to print at end,
put number mark in tempo mark next bar?
