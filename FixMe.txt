m. 12: Trombone III/Tuba crescendo messes up the score when I try to print it in any way.
Redacted it entirely from the score for now, although it's in the parts. Need to figure
out what's wrong. May be more partcombine magic I have to work around with silences.

m. 12: Convoluted hack for cello crescendo termination means the part can't combine rests.

m. 28: Piano reduction. Initial rest placement completely wrong. Changed but still needs work.

m. 29: Piano reduction. mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn only half-working.

m. 53: Violin II.  Don't like the g to the left of the f#. Should go other way.

m. 54: Piano reduction. Need to break up obnoxious "c and c#" chord like PR.

m. 55-62: Solo piano. Lower hand is a bit of a mess, needs tweaking.

m. 58: Clarinets have the tuplet bracket missing in score, probably due to colliding
with the Solo text. Maybe force tupletdown in score.

m. 69: Solo piano. Lilypond trying too hard with those quarter rests. Adjust placement?

m. 82-90: Solo piano. The tuplet brackets have a tendency to run up against accidentals
when things get tight. They probably need to be adjusted. The trick is, whether this is
true or not depends on how much horizontal squeeze there is. So the necessary tweak may
be different for score and PR, and may even be different if I change paper sizes. Should
only come back here once the whole movement is done.
Also in this same passage, the lower staff sometimes places the quintuplet figures
to the left of the whole notes, which is not what the PR does. I'm not sure if it's
worth changing, though.

m. 82-89: Flutes and Clarinets. Everybody gets the tuplet bracket eaten by PartCombine for
no obvious reason. I may have found a novel way to break it. (also, only use ottava for flute
2 in score, not part.)

m. 98-99: Piano reduction. Quarter rests too high. Switch it so that voiceOne is tranparent
and voiceTwo is printed?

m. 105: Bassoon III. Part prints fine. Score has the tuplet bracket end too soon. Lilypond bug?

m. 105: Bass line in this measure has rests too low because of the way I had to construct the
tuplet. Bump them back up to the center.

m. 113-121: Solo piano. Have to force stems up, because if the stems converge in the middle like
in the PR, lilypond does not put enough space between the staves for things to work. I prefer
the PR version. Look into prying apart the staves.

mm. 116-117 and 119-120: Flute I, missing/broken bracket on first figure. Also, nothing I can
do seems to persuade partcombine to put the stems down, which would make this less ugly.

m. 118 and 121: Clarinet III is missing tuplet bracket in score. Seems to be a problem similar
to the one in m. 58, above.

m. 134-141: Piano reduction needs markings showing right hand is optional.

m. 141: Grace notes at end of bar for flutes should be outside the bracket, but tricky to do.
Also, partcombine is not honoring the manual bar marks for flute II in the score. Part is fine.

m. 165-169: Solo piano has staves too close together to handle the cross-staff figures. Need
to force it to open up. Score too.

m. 224-225: Clarinets I and II combine badly in the score. Need to figure out a way to bring that
r32 into line.

m. 233: Trying to use LV as a cheat rather than tie across voices in PR, but tweak is not working.

m. 233-235: In solo piano, lilypond strugges with tuplet bracket placing. Needs hand-tuning.

m. 244 and 246: Solo piano, push staves apart a bit to allow the bracket to be on the opposite
side from the slur?
