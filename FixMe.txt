m. 12: Trombone III/Tuba crescendo messes up the score when I try to print it in any way.
Redacted it entirely from the score for now, although it's in the parts. Need to figure
out what's wrong.

m. 28: Piano reduction. Initial rest placement completely wrong. Changed but still needs work.

m. 29: Piano reduction. mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn only half-working.

m. 53: Violin II.  Don't like the g to the left of the f#. Should go other way.

m. 54: Piano reduction. Need to break up obnoxious "c and c#" chord like PR.

m. 55-62: Solo piano. Lower hand is a bit of a mess, needs tweaking.

m. 58: Clarinets have the tuplet bracket missing in score, probably due to colliding
with the Solo text.

m. 69: Solo piano. Lilypond trying too hard with those quarter rests. Adjust placement?

m. 82-90: Solo piano. The tuplet brackets have a tendency to run up against accidentals
when things get tight. They probably need to be adjusted. The trick is, whether this is
true or not depends on how much horizontal squeeze there is. So the necessary tweak may
be different for score and PR, and may even be different if I change paper sizes. Should
only come back here once the whole movement is done.

Fermata bar: add mark to previous bar and hack it to print at end,
put number mark in tempo mark next bar?
