General

The tempo markings often differ significantly between the piano reduction and
the full score and parts. The PR may have been done later than the score/parts,
and may represent the composer's final thoughts...but the score/parts were
never corrected, which may point against that theory. I am currently biased
towards the PR, but trying to blend the two in a way that makes sense.
Edits related to this are marked #TEMPO.

Dynamics are not always consistant. It is often difficult, when reading the
parts, to differentiate between what was originally written by the copyist
and what was a bit of markup by the performer. The score is often lacking
any clues. Edits related to this are marked #DYNAMICS.

The string divisi sections are complicated. I generally want to use a rule of
"what's in the score and in the part match up", but sometimes it clearly makes
more sense to compress the divisi, as in the MS full score, but write them in
separate staves for the player in the part. Playing this one by ear for now.
What makes this more fun is I can only "backfill" divisi lines with unison sections
in both by doing the compilation, noting where line/page breaks are, and using
that as a guide. Would be cool if that could be automated.

Movement I

m. 2: Horn I (score/part) has different rhythm than piano reduction.
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 5: The PR has "con moto" here. The parts have "moderato con moto" at m. 16.
The score has what *might* be a scribbled "con moto" at m. 5, and a stronger
"con moto" at m. 16 which might have been scratched out. #TEMPO
(I-common)

m. 6: Flutes I/II have an odd crescendo difference. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 6: Clarinet II has hairpins I lacks. Give them to I as well. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 7: Clarinet II has a decrescendo that I lacks, and is in the score. Give it to I as well.
#DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 10: The dynamics for this bar on Flutes, Oboes, Clarinets, Bassoons are kind of a mess.
Score looks like FF for everbody. Flute parts show FFF, oboe/clarinet/bassoon parts show FFFF,
and I'm not sure if these are markups or work of the copyist. I think they should be consistent,
though. Sticking with score; FF for all. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-03-clarinets, I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 10: The oboe parts all give the second half of the rhythm X8. X16. The score
oddly has X8 X8 for the first and second, and X8. X16 for the third and fourth.
That's pretty clearly a mistake in the score. But it does make me wonder: the other
instruments playing this rhythm (flute I/II, clarinet I/II has X8 R16 X16 instead.
Should I make the oboes consistant with the others (and the piano reduction)? Doing
that for now, but willing to reconsider.
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 12: Piccolo FFF in part, F in score. FFF could be copyist. Sticking with score,
as I have for measure 10.
#DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 12: Oboes I/I FF in score, FFF in part, but FFF could be copyist. Sticking with FFF
for now; if I revisit this one, should do it in conjunction with other dynamics in
measures 10 and 12. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 16: Flute I has mf scratched out and replaced with F in both score and part.
Seems official to me. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 19: put the "pocu piu/rit" in every part? Some parts have it under the rest.
Some don't.
(I-common)

mm. 21-23: Solo piano, 2PR, same notes but different transition points for
clefs. Bad idea? Regularize like FS to match MM 21?
(I-solo-piano)

m. 21 and 23: Clarinet and oboe solos have mf in score and (originally) parts, but
parts had it scratched out and replaced with f. Sticking with mf for now. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 25: Clarinets I and III have mf in score like everyone else, player replaced with mp.
Sticking with original. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 25: Tempo discrepancy. PR is "Appassionata, ma molto sostenuto" and the
score and parts are just "Appasionata". #TEMPO
(I-common)

m. 29: Oboes have fff in the parts, f in the score. I think the fff is something
written in by the performer. Sticking with score dynamic for now. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 29: Bassoons I and II are in unison, but whoever copied the parts put I in tenor
clef and II in bass clef. Absent a compelling reason, I'm just keeping both in tenor.
(I-orch-04-bassoons)

mm. 29-38: Violas bar layout inconsistant between score and parts. Parts break up,
score doesn't. Sticking with score for now.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

mm. 29-38: There are a bunch of crescendo/decrescendo bits in the string parts which
aren't in the score. I can't tell yet if these are from the copyist or were added
by players. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-09-violins-viola I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m.35: Solo piano lower staff; unconvinced the bottom a-sharp on the second beat
of m. 35 is correct in the PR. Full score is a bit smudgy here but doesn't show
an accidental. Also doesn't match m. 37 which otherwise repeats the pattern. Going
with the pattern and following the full score.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 36 and 38: Oboes and bassoons have the "half-broken beam" in the score. The bassoons
have it in the parts. The oboes do not; changing them to match the score.
(I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 36 and 38:  Also interesting is that the bassoons and the oboes slur differently in
these measures.In practice, it amounts to the same thing (why push a slur over a tie?
It gets "slurred" anyway). Can't use the score as a tiebreaker because the score doesn't
have the slurs at all. Leaving them inconsistent for now.
(I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 39: Bottom staff of solo piano has an obvious error in the PR, missing a bass clef
transistion. It's there in the full score. Fixed.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 45: Placement of the "cresc." is a bit odd. PR places it squarely in beat 3; the score
seems to suggest 2 or 2-1/2, and the parts show either 2 or 3 depending on how you read
them. I'm sticking with 3.
