General

The tempo markings often differ significantly between the piano reduction and
the full score and parts. The PR may have been done later than the score/parts,
and may represent the composer's final thoughts...but the score/parts were
never corrected, which may point against that theory. I am currently trying
to blend the two in a way that makes sense.

Movement I

m. 2: Horn I (score/part) has different rhythm than piano reduction.
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 5: The PR has "con moto" here. The parts have "moderato con moto" at m. 16.
The score has what *might* be a scribbled "con moto" at m. 5, and a stronger
"con moto" at m. 16 which might have been scratched out.
(I-common)

m. 19: put the "pocu piu/rit" in every part? Some parts have it under the rest.
Some don't.
(I-common)

mm. 21-23: Solo piano, 2PR, same notes but different transition points for
clefs. Bad idea? Regularize like FS to match MM 21?
(I-solo-piano)

m. 29: Tempo discrepancy. PR is "Appassionata, ma molto sostenuto" and the
score and parts are just "Appasionata".
(I-common)
