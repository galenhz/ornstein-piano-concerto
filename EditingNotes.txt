General

The tempo markings often differ significantly between the piano reduction and
the full score and parts. The PR may have been done later than the score/parts,
and may represent the composer's final thoughts. I am currently biased towards
the PR, but trying to blend the two in a way that makes sense when needed. Edits
related to this are marked #TEMPO.

Dynamics are not always consistent. It is often difficult, when reading the
parts, to differentiate between what was originally written by the copyist
and what was a bit of markup by the performer. The score is often lacking
any clues. Edits related to this are marked #DYNAMICS.

Anything marked #UNDECIDED is something that I haven't made up my mind on,
and need to look at later. Eventually these should vanish.

The string divisi sections are complicated. I generally want to use a rule of
"what's in the score and in the part match up", but sometimes it clearly makes
more sense to compress the divisi, as in the MS full score, but write them in
separate staves for the player in the part. Playing this one by ear for now.
What makes this more fun is I can only "backfill" divisi lines with unison sections
in both by doing the compilation, noting where line/page breaks are, and using
that as a guide. Would be cool if that could be automated.

Movement I

m. 2: Horn I (score/part) has different rhythm than piano reduction.
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 5: The PR has "con moto" here. The parts have "moderato con moto" at m. 16.
The score has what *might* be a scribbled "con moto" at m. 5, and a stronger
"con moto" at m. 16 which might have been scratched out. #TEMPO
(I-common)

m. 6: Flutes I/II have an odd crescendo difference. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 6: Clarinet II has hairpins I lacks. Give them to I as well. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 6: Horns III and IV have different dynamics in part (mf and f), but same in score.
Going with MF in score. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-06-horns)

m. 7: Clarinet II has a decrescendo that I lacks, and is in the score. Give it to I as well.
#DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 10: The dynamics for this bar on Flutes, Oboes, Clarinets, Bassoons are kind of a mess.
Score looks like FF for everbody. Flute parts show FFF, oboe/clarinet/bassoon parts show FFFF,
and I'm not sure if these are markups or work of the copyist. I think they should be consistent,
though. Sticking with score; FF for all. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-03-clarinets, I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 10: The oboe parts all give the second half of the rhythm X8. X16. The score
oddly has X8 X8 for the first and second, and X8. X16 for the third and fourth.
That's pretty clearly a mistake in the score. But it does make me wonder: the other
instruments playing this rhythm (flute I/II, clarinet I/II has X8 R16 X16 instead.
Should I make the oboes consistent with the others (and the piano reduction)? Doing
that for now, but willing to reconsider.
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 12: Piccolo FFF in part, F in score. FFF could be copyist. Sticking with score,
as I have for measure 10. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 12: Oboes I/I FF in score, FFF in part, but FFF could be copyist. Sticking with FFF
for now; if I revisit this one, should do it in conjunction with other dynamics in
measures 10 and 12. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 12: Horns V/VI have first FF then FFF in the part. Only FF may have backing in
score, but looks like copyist. Keeping for now.
(I-orch-06-horns)

m. 16: Flute I has mf scratched out and replaced with F in both score and part.
Seems official to me. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 19: put the "pocu piu/rit" in every part? Some parts have it under the rest.
Some don't. #UNDECIDED
(I-common)

mm. 21-23: Solo piano, 2PR, same notes but different transition points for
clefs. Bad idea? Regularize like FS to match MM 21? #UNDECIDED
(I-solo-piano)

m. 21 and 23: Clarinet and oboe solos have mf in score and (originally) parts, but
parts had it scratched out and replaced with f. Sticking with mf for now. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 25: Clarinets I and III have mf in score like everyone else, player replaced with mp.
Sticking with original. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 25: Tempo discrepancy. PR is "Appassionata, ma molto sostenuto" and the
score and parts are just "Appasionata". #TEMPO
(I-common)

mm. 25-28: There are a bunch of crescendo/decrescendo bits in Violin I/II which
aren't in the score. I can't tell yet if these are from the copyist or were added
by players. I've got them in the Cellos, and at least some of them look real.
Adding them to all string parts. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

mm. 25-28: And for that matter, note the flute and oboe are both playing into
those same string parts...the flute has hairpins, and the oboe does not. Flute
hairpins aren't quite aligned with the string ones, either. Either both should
have them or neither. Thinking it over. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 27: Viola slurring different from all their neighbors. Adjusting to match.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 29: Oboes have fff in the parts, f in the score. I think the fff is something
written in by the performer. Sticking with score dynamic for now. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 29: Bassoons I and II are in unison, but whoever copied the parts put I in tenor
clef and II in bass clef. Absent a compelling reason, I'm just keeping both in tenor.
(I-orch-04-bassoons)

mm. 29-38: Violas bar layout inconsistent between score and parts. Parts break up,
score doesn't. Sticking with score for now.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

mm. 29-38: There are a bunch of crescendo/decrescendo bits in all the string parts
which aren't in the score. I can't tell yet if these are from the copyist or were
added by players. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-09-violins-viola I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 35: Solo piano lower staff; unconvinced the bottom a-sharp on the second beat
of m. 35 is correct in the PR. Full score is a bit smudgy here but doesn't show
an accidental. Also doesn't match m. 37 which otherwise repeats the pattern. Going
with the pattern and following the full score.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 36 and 38: Oboes and bassoons have the "half-broken beam" in the score. The bassoons
have it in the parts. The oboes do not; changing them to match the score.
(I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 36 and 38:  Also interesting is that the bassoons and the oboes slur differently in
these measures.In practice, it amounts to the same thing (why push a slur over a tie?
It gets "slurred" anyway). Can't use the score as a tiebreaker because the score doesn't
have the slurs at all. Leaving them inconsistent for now.
(I-orch-02-oboes, I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 39: Bottom staff of solo piano has an obvious error in the PR, missing a bass clef
transistion. It's there in the full score. Fixed.
(I-solo-piano)

mm. 39-53: The articulation patterns start out clearly in score and parts; we have
accented beats, and everything else is staccato. The score stops writing them after
three bars, but the various parts continue. Some parts, like bassoons and first
clarinet, start losing them in m. 50...but the score, at least for bassoons
and flutes, seems to still have the staccato notes. Trumpet and Horn parts keep
them as well.
This almost certainly should be made consistent. As editor, my vote is to just
keep them for everyone for now.
Crescendos in this section are sometimes not consistent; I've regularized this in
what I think is a reasonable way. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-*)

m. 44: Clarinets get a > on their final note of the phrase; oboes do not. Score hasn't
had the > for several measures, despite them being in the parts, so can't use it as a
tiebreaker. Bassoons have them too. Tympani doesn't, though. Viola part is missing the
articulations entirely. Should make this consistent, but in what direction? #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 45: Placement of the "cresc." is a bit odd. PR places it squarely in beat 3; the score
seems to suggest 2 or 2-1/2, and the parts show either 2 or 3 depending on how you read
them. I'm sticking with 2 for the orchestra, but leaving at 3 in the piano for now.
Will probably revisit.
(I-solo-piano)

mm. 50-54: Trumpet III/IV parts show them playing in unison (almost) throughout. Score
seems to suggest that it starts as trumpet III only with IV added at some point. Following
the parts.
(I-orch-05-trumpets)

m. 52: Cello part and score do not match. Cello score repeats m. 51, but part copies the bass
line. I think this was an error by the copyist. Using the score pattern.
(I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 53: The parts which have a FFF on beat 1 omit it on beat 3, except for Tympani.
Perhaps make tympani consistent with everbody else here? #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-08-tympani)

mm. 55-62: The orchestra parts, playing in unison, don't have consistent handling of either
the dynamic hairpins (throughout) or some of the slurs at the end of measures (mm. 59-62).
For the former, several examples: a decrecendo for the bass in 55 that no one else has,
a crescendo in strings in 58 missing from the clarinets, a decrescendo in 59 that's not
starting from the same place in all parts (and missing from cello). Score not helpful;
there might be faint traces of hairpins but I can't tell. Bringing them into a consistent
state for now. As for the slurs, clarinets and cellos have them, and the viola has one.
They make musical sense. Adding them to everybody. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets, I-orch-04-bassoons, I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 55: "Moderato" evolved to "Meno mosso". This has been changed in some parts. #TEMPO
(I-common)

mm. 55-58: Solo piano right hand PR has inconsistent handling of the ottavas between
measures 55 and 57. Same notes, just different cutoff point. Score does it like 55 both times
(although amusingly the actual ottava line is missing). My repeat structure copies 55's
handling in both cases, but 57's seems a little easier on the eye.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 58: The score and piano reduction use a "duplet" figure on the third beat, but most
of the parts just print that as a pair of dotted eighth notes. Harmonizing on duplets.
(I-orch-03-clarinets, I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 58: PR doesn't repeat the "broken beams" that are in m. 56. Score does.
I don't see any reason not to.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 60: The solo piano in the PR doesn't have the continuing ties in the left hand middle voice,
but it's clearly there in the score. Fixed.
(I-solo-piano)

mm. 60-62: Like 55-58, the ottava is handled differently in PR, same in score.
(I-solo-piano)

mm. 60-62: The hairpins stop here in score and parts. Speculation: should I continue
adding them according to the pattern? Next mark is the "piu dim" in 63. #DYNAMICS
#UNDECIDED
(I-orch-03-clarinets, I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 63: Beat 2, the clarinet part has broken bars, and so do score lower strings, but
lower string parts don't. It's pretty much free for me, so I'll do it.
Also...do I want to add slurs to the second beat for low strings, matching clarinets?
Listen to the recording, see if I can hear slurring. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 64-69: Dynamics all over the place. I've copied various hairpins from parts. Needs
attention. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 70-73: The score and parts ask Tympani I (a-e) to field a b-flat here, which the player
seems to have balked at; they scratched out the "e-flat to b-flat" directive from the
copyist. Sticking with score.
(I-orch-08-tympani)

m. 82: "Andante con moto" became "Andante e molto sostenuto". This is changed in the score
and some parts. #TEMPO
(I-common)

m. 84 and 86: The horn parts and score indicate a simple triplet on the first beat, but it looks
like there might have been white-out involved there. The PR plays a X8 X8 R16 X16 on both beats.
Recording is straight triplets. Allowing the discrepancy to stand for now, but might want to adjust
this in PR as well.
(I-orch-06-horns, I-piano-reduction)

m. 91: Clarinet I/II lack starting dynamic, III/IV has p. Nothing in score. Giving dynamic
to all. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 93: Clarinets lack dynamics in this bar that appear to be in score, plus bassoons. Adding
them in. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 91 and 93: Full score shows crescendos for all the strings in 91, but only for Violin I in 93.
It seems strange that the other string parts would be expected to just jump from mp to ff, so
adding them to other strings as well. In fact, since the strings are playing in accord, it makes
the most sense to harmonize everybody across this section.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 94: Dynamics are f for all wind parts except for Bassoon IV, whose part could be either f or ff.
Score clearly gives a strong ff in m. 92, but is silent in 94 except for what might be pencilled in
f on the bassoons, and strong f in the horns. Making it consistent F for winds/brass. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-*)

mm. 95-97: The second beat ^ articulations are again inconsistent. Score gives them to everbody
in 95, bassoons/horns only in 96, and nobody in 97. Violin II is missing in part entirely, so
adding at least the ^ in 95. For now, leaving everything else as score and parts have it.
(I-orch-*)

m. 100: Clarinets III/IV started life as P, got corrected hard in both score and parts to FF.
The re-entry of clarinets at m. 106 has not been changed from P. Sticking with original for now
but in practice, I can see why that would have to be changed. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 101: The piano reduction ends the bar with d-flat; the english horn solo it's following has 
d-natural in both score and part. Adjusting reduction to match.
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 103-105: There are tremolos in the Violin I (II?) and Viola in the score. They are completely
absent from the parts; just rests, as though they were never there. Leaving them out for now,
but... #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 103-105: The clarinet melody is marked as "Solo I" in the score...but it's in both the I
and II parts. Really unsure about this one. Going with parts for now.
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 113-121: The dynamics in this section are actually pretty consistent. Only need to adjust
a few oddities. Violin II seems to be lacking things everyone else has; adding them. Cello
has a decrescendo in m. 117 in the part which matches nothing anywhere else; removing. Bass
missing a crescendo in m. 118. There's a "dim" in the score in m. 121, and is in all wind/brass
parts, but not the strings, so adding it there. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-*)

m. 116 and 119: Change Clarinet I's slurring to match everybody else playing the same line.
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 122: Clarinet I has a sFz in the part which looks like copyist's work but isn't in the
score. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 122-123: Dynamics in flutes and Clarinets are kind of odd. The score shows some of it
but parts apply it differently. This requires looking at. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 134-141: The cello part contains more slurs than are found in the viola part, or the score
(which matches the viola part). Specifically it slurs the second and third notes in the first
bars of the phrase (134 and 138), plus a slur on the triplet in the last bar. They look like
they *could* be copyist's work but I have doubts. I can certainly believe the composer wanted
the last triplet to be bowed rather than slurred, for a more forceful effect. Making cello
match viola/score for now.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 141: Flute I part and score clearly show grace notes leading into 142. Flute IV score
seems to show something similar, but Flute IV part has them written in explicit rhythm,
and then crossed out. Keeping it, but making them grace notes in parallel with I.
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 142-146: Viola/Cello slur wierdness continues. Cello parts have slurs on the 5/4 tuplets,
viola parts don't, but score seems to show slurs for the viola that aren't in the part?
Adding slurs to the viola here.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 142-146: The descending triplet figure is inconsistently barred in the flute and bassoon
parts where it occurs. Score has Flute I grouped into 6 in 142, Flute II continuous in 143,
Flute I grouped in 6 again in 144, and bassoon first grouped then continuous in 145-146.
The parts have flute I always grouped, flute II continuous, and Bassoon I grouped.
The PR reduction carries these lines as well, but is also inconsistent: 142-143 is continuous,
144-146 grouped. For simple reasons of aesthetics these should be the same, since they're
all the same basic musical material. Using 6-note groupings.
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-04-bassoons, I-piano-reduction)

m. 142 and 144: Flute IV has slurs at 142 in the part which look like copyist work, but
seem only pencilled in at that point on the score. (Perhaps it's just weakly scanned.)
Parallel passage at 144 for flute II has no slurs. It makes musical sense that either
both or neither should have them. Making it both.
(I-orch-01-flutes)

m. 155-164: Clarinet I has slurs in part that look like copyist, but pencilled in score.
Keeping for now.
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 165-169: Slurs for the orchestra line aren't evenly distributed, but if you assume
that everbody gets everbody's slurs, it sounds a lot like what I hear in the recording.
One gotcha, though, is the slur that starts in 169 on the third eighth note. Does it cover
two notes or three? Violin I, Basses say two. Violin II, Violas, Cellos don't have it.
Clarinet I has a three-note slur pencilled in, as do Bassoons I and III. Recording has...
three? Leaving at two for now but need to think about this some more.
(I-orch-*)

m. 168-169: Score and parts show a single 14/8 measure here, which was apparantly broken
up later into 6/8 and 8/8. PR reflects that.
(I-orch-*)

m. 168: The parts have various versions of "piu animato" and "poco/piu a poco/piu crescendo".
The score just has "piu animato e crescendo". (PR has nothing.) Using score version
universally.
(I-orch-*)

m. 170: The score just has "Allegro" with the "con forza" added to the various parts. PR folded
it into a single tempo directive. Going with that. #TEMPO
(I-common)

m. 170-174: Some parts have the time signatures scratched out and replaced by a 5/8 time which
matches the repeating orchestra pattern. PR maintains the original pattern, so I'm keeping it.
(I-orch-*)

m. 170-174: Viola part seems to have been rewritten at some point. The four-note figure was
changed from an ascending one to just playing e repeatedly. Score looks like whiteout may
have been applied for the same end, and the piano reduction matches that pattern. They also
lack the downbow marks that are in the other string parts: adding those.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 175: The first chord in the solo piano upper voice has a "c and c-sharp" note cluster as
written in the PR. All of the slashed graces that follow in this section have "b-sharp and
c-sharp" clusters. Since I can't (yet) replicate the split-stem trick the copyist used in the
PR, change the first c to b-sharp.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 175-181: Articulation in the orchestra unison line is odd. The Trumpet and Bass Clarinet
show slurs on the 16th figures. Oboes had them but scratched them out, and had a slur
on the opening two notes almost nobody else has. The score has some slurs, most consistently for
the horns. Parts show staccato and ^ accents for many instruments, but they're not in the
score at all. Can't tell if they're copyist work or not.
The recording seems to have the slurs on the 16th notes. Going with that as a reasonable base.
I'm also considering adding some of the accents, since I added them starting in m. 253.
#UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 178: Similar slur problems in this measure. Violins part (and pencil in score) slur two
groups of four, cello part in four groups of two (with nothing in score). Not sure.
Changing cello to match violin for now.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 183 and 185: PR has the reduction just play the same chord 5 times. This doesn't
match the orchestra, which changes on the final 8th note of the 5/8 bars. I should
probably adjust the reduction. #UNDECIDED
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 186-187: Violas and Basses have a bogus b-flat instead of b in parts. Score seems right
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 190: Solo piano lower hand has a clef transition that happens in the first half of the
measure, and not in the second. It really should be both or neither. Neither for now.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 193: Viola part has g-f-aes on beat three. All other instruments have g-e-aes. Score
is iffy, but it's pretty clear that the line is supposed to be unison. Making viola
match everybody else.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 194 and 196: PR reduction left hand and bass score/part don't have matching rhythms
in the second half of these bars. This time it might make sense to change the PR to
match the orchestra. #UNDECIDED
(I-piano-reduction, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 194-197: First violin and clarinet have different slurring patterns. Violin part
has pencilled in slurs more like clarinet. Score shows violin matching it's part, but
one extra slur (16ths in beat 4) in the part. Leaving things as copyist has them for
now.
(I-orch-03-clarinets, I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 194-197: The string parts have hairpins in these measures (except viola, which tends
to miss a lot of this stuff) which aren't in other parts (clarinet, tympani, etc.). The
score has a marked-in version of these written over the string section...not sure by
who. These are compelling enough that I'm adding them to the other parts which play in these
bars. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-*)

m. 199: The bass part has hairpins in this bar which aren't found in any other part, but are
written into the score above the string section, much like the hairpins mentioned in the
previous entry. Interestingly, these are inverted "><" compared to the earlier ones.
Not 100% sure what to do with this one. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 202-207: The Mystery of Violin II's missing D drone. The part is simple; a single
Violin II line alternating between b-flat and c-sharp. The score, on the other hand,
has a d combined (apparantly as a double-stop) with all of these notes throughout this
passage. The entire Violin I section is whited out in the score, which may mean the
added notes were moved from Violin I into Violin II, to decrease the number
of strings playing without losing the note. The problem with this theory is that the
Violin I part has no white-out; it just has written rests, as though there were
never anything there...and the Violin II part doesn't have the Ds at all. Perhaps
the parts were written at different times, but they look like they came from the
same group. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 202-207: Flute I part has a penciled in slur over the repeated phrase. Similar
penciled in slur in the score. Clarinet I has a similar slur in the score when it joins
in, but nothing in the part. Should I add it? #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 212-215: Dynamics (especially in strings) are wierd. Need rectification. #DYNAMICS
#UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 212-214: Score shows stems both up and down on horn I/II line, indicating the horns
should be playing in unison, but the Horn I/II part shows this as Horn I alone. Going
with part.
(I-orch-06-horns)

m. 213: Bassoon III and IV parts show the same notes here. Score shows bassoon III
and IV have different values on the dotted half note. Going with score here.
(I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 213: Viola b-flat combines a tremolo 8th with a tie to the half note. Lilypond can't
seem to time this right (it inserts an extra triplet 8th) and it doesn't make sense
anyway. Violin I doesn't have it in part, although the score shows it for both. It
really needs to be one or the other, physically speaking. Right now leaving it without
the tie, but it might make more sense to leave the tremolo off the last triplet note
instead.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 214: Solo piano PR is missing an ottava notation which is in the parallel passage
at m. 212. The score has it, so it's definitely supposed to be there.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 215: The strings have crescendo text, the winds/brass have hairpins. Really should
be one or the other. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 216-219: Violin II bottom divisi alternates between bars of b and bars of b-flat in
the score. The part has one bar of b and three of b-flat. The score matches what the
piano reduction does, so going with that.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 216-225: Cello part goes pizzicato in 217, but never goes back to arco, even though
it definitely needs to by 224 at the very latest, and probably in 221 for the dotted
half. The score simply never has them go to pizzicato at all! (The marking in the part
seems to be hand-written.) I'm splitting the difference here; we'll go with pizzicato
on the "strums", but switch to arco for the long notes and in 224.
(I-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 224-225: Violin II part has -- marks in the part and the score. Violin I has them
in the score but not in the part. Cellos have in both. Adding them to Violin I.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 224-225: Trombones I/II...why bother with tenor clef? Seems pointless. Switch
to bass? Commenting out clef changes for now. May revisit. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-07-trombones-tuba)

m. 225: Trumpet I has slurs written into the score but not in the part. Adding them.
May revisit.
(I-orch-05-trumpets)

m. 226-232: In the score, the piano is in 6/8 and the orchestra in 3/4. In the PR, the
orchestra piano is in 6/8 along with the solo, but since they're playing a rhythm in a
3/4 pattern, it makes sense for them to match the full score.
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 226-232: The solo horn part (and its transcription in the orchestra reduction) is
written in an odd way; a dotted quarter tied to an eighth note, as though the part was
in 6/8...even though it's clearly in 3/4 like the rest of the orchestra. It might make
more sense to change this to a half note, to fit the 3/4 beat pattern. I wonder if this
is an artifact of an earlier draft where the entire orchestra was in 6/8. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-06-horns, I-piano-reduction)

m. 235: The piano reduction is playing the flute notes in the right hand, but it doesn't
actually match the flute part. The second half of the bar just repeats itself in the
reduction, the flute changes to a septuplet with one extra note (f#). Adjusting the
piano reduction to do what the orchestra does.
(I-piano-reduction)

m. 236-239: String dynamics are a mix of bits missing from various parts and scores.
Brought them into a consistent shape. #DYNAMICS
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 236: Bass clarinet tremolo is written incorrectly in the part and score. Dotted eights
instead of dotted quarters. Fixed.
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

mm. 236-243: Trombone I/II flips in and out of tenor clef, but like 224-225, why bother?
Commenting out clef changes. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-07-trombones-tuba)

m. 237: Solo piano in PR missing a treble clef transition in left hand.

complete review. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 242: Solo piano bass clef transition in PR in bar 242 clearly a mistake, based on
shared pattern between bars 241 and 243.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 244-247: Piano reduction is very congested here. It really needs a middle staff.
Added one.
(I-piano-reduction)

mm. 245 and 247: Solo piano in PR breaks up the 16ths at the end of 247 but not 245.
Score breaks it up in both. Following the score.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 246: Viola has no slurs over the tremolos and no accents, although it has both in
244. The score agrees, but honestly it makes sense just to make 246 match 244.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 248: The ottava ends a beat too early in the PR. Score seems correct.
(I-solo-piano)

mm. 248-252: Speculation...I've already broken out a middle staff once. Perhaps there
is a case for doing something like that here? Switch right hand to bass clef in m. 249,
and use a new top staff in mm. 250-252 for the eighth note figures? Trouble with
that is the top staff would still have those deep-dipping notes, which would eat
vertical space. #UNDECIDED
(I-piano-reduction)

mm. 253-264: Once again, revisit the dynamics here. I think this makes more sense
than other parts of the score; I can combine the score and parts into something coherent
at least. I like the accents/dynamics in the oboes and horn parts, so I'm keeping them.
The more I work, the more I think I'm going to have to end up compromising by putting
in some of the better pencil stuff, just to have something there. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-*)

m. 270: Solo piano has f natural in beat 8 of the right hand in PR, but score says f#,
and the repetition of the pattern points to f#. Corrected.
(I-solo-piano)

m. 272: Solo piano in PR has whole note opening in bass...in a 6/8 bar. Same in score.
It could be code for "let this ring as long as feasable rather than just cut off at the
bar line." Making it a dotted half to fit the bar, but this might be worth reverting.
#UNDECIDED
(I-solo-piano)

m. 272-280: Just as a note, this entire section started life as three bars: 2 17/8
bars and a 6/8 bar. This is still reflected in the parts and score, which were scribbled
with corrections.

m. 272-280: The parts for the main orchestral melodic line have accents which aren't
in the score, but I believe they are worth including, like the ones in 253-264. The
patterns do not always line up within the parts. Here is the melodic pattern,
and how various parts accent it.

X = scratched out in part, () = clearly written by performer not copyist
Melody:    r8 eis fis g a8. a16 | c8 bes16 a bes a g8 | a16 g fis ees fis g a8 c bes16 a | g
Oboe 3/4:               ^       | ^                ^  |                     ^  ^
Horn 1/2:               ^       | ^                X  |       ^             ^  ^ (^)       ^
Horn 3/4:               ^       | ^                ^  |       ^             ^  ^           ^
Tpt 3/4:                ^       | ^                ^  |       ^             ^  ^           ^

The "consensus" version would look like this:

Consensus:              ^         ^                ^          ^             ^  ^           ^

Also, slurs. Unlike the accents, these are pencilled into the score. Quick comparison chart here:

S = Score only, P = Part only, nothing = both, X = in score but scratched out in part
Melody:    r8 eis fis g a8. a16 | c8 bes16 a bes a g8 | a16 g fis ees fis g a8 c bes16 a | g
Oboe 3/4:                             S(   ) S(  )      S(  ) S(   )  S(  )        S(  )
Horn 1/2:     P(   )    X(   )        X(   ) X(  )      X(  ) X(   )  X(  )        X(  )
Horn 3/4:     P(   )     (   )         (   )  (  )      S(  ) S(   )  S(  )        S(  )
Tpt 3/4:      P(   )    S(   )        X(   ) X(  )      X(  ) X(   )  X(  )        X(  )

"Audio" represents what I seem to be hearing on the recording. For now, I'm going with that.
#UNDECIDED

m. 272-280: Beam the Violin I and II parts more like the score. Violin II is written out in
score throughout, part switches quickly to tremolo. Going full tremolo, like Violin I.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 279: Horns V/VI beamed slightly differently in part than in score. Trombone parts match score.
Adjusting horns.

mm. 281-290: Flute articulations are mismatched beween score/part. Review later. #UNDECIDED

mm. 281-290: Trumpets III/IV follow the melody line, but they aren't slurred in the parts like the
other instruments. Sticking with the way the strings do it for now, but should revisit. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-05-trumpets)

mm. 281-290: Trombones in score don't match the part very well. Trombone II in score plays first
half of first bar an octave below Trombone I before moving to the held g, but in the part it's
just a g whole note. Trombone III is the opposite: the part shows it playing the first half of the
first bar like I, but the score just shows a g whole note. In practice, what that means is we get
the expected results with different players. To keep things cleaner, I'm going with the score.
(I-orch-07-trombones-tuba)

mm. 281-290: Beam strings consistently like score. Use broken beams in violin I, group II/Va/Vcl
like score.
(I-orch-09-violins-viola, I-orch-10-cello-bass)

mm. 283-284: Oboe III/IV parts incorrectly written as tuplets. Going with score.
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 290: "molto dim" in score and some parts, make it universal. Exact placement is debatable,
going with second beat to match score. Not implemented yet; holding out for upgrade to
newer lilypond for the new "after" trick. #UNIMPLEMENTED
(I-orch-*)

m. 291: The score and parts have "meno allegro"; this never made it into the PR. #TEMPO
(I-orch-*)

m. 291-296: Violin I has an accent/dot structure in these bars which isn't in the score. See if
other parts have it. Cello has staccato dots but not accents. Flutes have dots.

m. 294: Oboe I/II copyist reworked the first beat of this bar. Score is as follows: "d des ces
cis b bes", parts have "d cis b cis b bes". Oboe III matches the score. Going with score.
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 294: English Horn fourth beat has a nonsensical rhythm in both score and part. Even if it's
not a triplet, the X8 R16 X16 pattern doesn't fit. Furthermore, it's the only instrument which
even *has* a rhythmic pattern like that. I'm going on the assumption that it's supposed to
be different, and align vertically with the rest of the score. X16 R16 X16 it is.
(I-orch-02-oboes)

m. 294: Bassoon I/II in the score split into two notes on the last beat, and the II part seems
to have been written this way, but at some point the d was scratched out and replaced with b-flats
like Bassoon I. Right now following parts, but should review this one. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 295-296: Trumpet I/II part shows only II playing for these bars, but the score has an "a 2"
written in; it may be a later addition, since the stems on those notes are pointed down, like
you'd expect for solo II. Trumpet III/IV part is the same way, but the score does not have "a 2"
and there are written rests to represent III. Will go with parts for now but should review.
#UNDECIDED
(I-orch-05-trumpets)

m. 297-300: Flutes have slurs not in any other part, but in score. Trumpets have similiar slurs
in parts, but not score. Remove? Adjust flutes to work like trumpets? #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-01-flutes, I-orch-05-trumpets)

m. 300: Violin I has three accents on the last three notes. Score backs the rest of the accents
but not those. Many wind parts have the same accents, but lower strings and tympani don't. Just
going part-by-part for now but will probably want to figure this out when I go over the rest of this
section later. #UNDECIDED

m. 300: Trumpet III/IV part has an accent structure that doesn't match anybody else. Adjusting to
match I/II.

m. 303: Some of the parts have this measure as 3/4, like the original passage in m. 15. The score
changed it to 6/8, and PR agrees.

m. 304-308: Violas don't have the "con sord" mark that they have in the parallel passage at
mm. 16-20. Composer oversight? Leaving it as written for now. Slurs are gone too, but I'm leaving
them in for copy-paste reasons. And for that matter, the dynamics marked in 16-20 aren't here either.
Should I copy them in for all parts? #UNDECIDED

mm. 309-311: Solo piano; same questions about clef transitions as mm. 21-23.
(I-solo-piano)

mm. 328-320: Bass Clarinet slurs are different in the score and part. Part does the whole phrase as
one slur. Score slices it up. Recording sounds like part, but it's hard to tell. Leaving this as
in the part for now. #UNDECIDED
(I-orch-03-clarinets)

m. 331: Bass cuts out and has a rest in this bar in the part. It looks like the score started that way
but was edited later to have the bass carry into the last bar like the cello part. Going with the score
change.

Movement II

m. 4: Piccolo and flute I have extra slurs in the score that aren't in the part. They match the previous
phrase, so adding them in.
(II-orch-01-flutes)

mm. 5-6: Flute I/II, Oboe I/II, Clarinet I/II, Bass Clarinet and Bassoon I have differing articulations
on the same rhythmic pattern. Score originally had X( X) x pattern on the first two triplets. Flute I/I
parts replace it with X( X X)-. as do Oboe I/II (the original pattern is scratched out), Clarinet I/II,
and Bassoon I. Bass Clarinet has the original pattern from the score. And in the score, this modification is
in the flute part, but not any of the others. Going with the replacement pattern for all.
(II-orch-01-flutes, II-orch-02-oboes, II-orch-03-clarinets, II-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 7: Several parts have "slower" as the tempo indicator here. Score has something crossed out, replaced by
handwritten metronome mark. PR has same metronome mark. Going with that. #TEMPO

mm. 7-12: Piano reduction again gets a middle staff to avoid congestion.
(II-piano-reduction)

mm. 8, 10: Piano reduction doesn't bar the way the score and parts do. Adjust? #UHNDECIDED
(II-piano-reduction)

m. 14: So far I've simply copied the rehearsal marks from the orchestral material without changing anything.
But some of the marks are...not where I would put them. This is a good example; mark 39 musically belongs
in measure 13. At some point I need to decide how much deference I should give the materials here. #UNDECIDED
(II-*)

m. 14, 16: The PR moves the lower staff to treble clef in m. 16 but not 14. There's no difference in the
musical material. It really should be both measures, or neither. The score does neither. Sticking with that.
(II-solo-piano)

m. 17: PR moves bottom note from b-flat to d, clearly an error if you check the score.
(II-piano-reduction)

mm. 25-31: Score originally (and some parts still do) had this section as 4/4, 8/4, 10/4, and 9/4. This was
reworked into what made it into the PR: 4/4 * 4, 3/2, 4/4, 5/4.

mm. 25-31: Solo piano just leaves the lower staff blank instead of inserting rests. This is pretty common, and
perhaps I should mimic this here and silence the rests in the lower staff. #UNDECIDED
(II-solo-piano)

m. 32: Score has "Allegro" for tempo; parts and PR do not. Following PR. #TEMPO

m. 40: PR has only one 8va section in this bar; score has two. The version with two makes more sense, as it makes
this symmetrical with m. 41.
(II-solo-piano)

m. 41: Where does the "rit." belong? Score puts it roughly on the second half of beat 3 for the bassoons, the
fourth quarter of beat 3 for the solo piano, and the middle of the eigth-note triplets for cello/bass. (Clarinets
I/II have it in the middle of the triplet, but it could easily go at the start, since it should already have
started by then.) Bassoon parts put it in the fourth quarter of beat 3. It's missing entirely in the bass part.
The PR seems to put it on the second half of beat 3 for the reduction, but maybe a 32nd earlier for the solo
part. Second half of beat 3 it is.

m. 41: The second bassoon part has the middle note of it's figure "corrected" to c, to match the first bassoon.
The score still has the b, and the parallel passages for flute and clarinet also still have the difference.
Going with score.
(II-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 41: The cello part has a quarter note rest in the beginning of this bar, but in the score, the rest has been
scratched out and replaced with a b-flat, like the basses.

mm. 50-53: Violins/violas have more slurs in score than in the parts; following score.
(II-orch-09-violins-viola)

mm. 56-57 and 61-62: PR Solo piano left hand plays the same notes in each of these bars, yet every bar seems
to put the clef transitions in a different place. It's just...wierd. Oh, and the first passage is written with
eighth notes in the 7-tuplet, and the second with 16th notes. Just the PR though, score is 16ths in both locations.
The score also keeps a static clef pattern, and I think it's the one that makes most sense. Doing this one like
the score.
(II-solo-piano)

m. 59: Solo piano (PR and score) uses quarter notes inside the duplet. Doesn't it make more sense if they're eighths?
Lilypond math works out better if they are. I'm putting them as eighths for now, but will review. #UNDECIDED
(II-solo-piano)

mm. 63-65: Violin II and Viola have held notes for these three bars in the score. They're just rests in the parts,
no sign of correction. Siding with the parts for now. May revisit. #UNDECIDED
(II-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 63 and 65: Score has bassoon III/IV parts with the expected relation, III taking the upper part. The parts have
this reversed, and I can't think of any particular reason why they would be. Going with score.
(II-orch-04-bassoons)

mm. 63-65: Clarinet I part has no slurs. Clarinet II part and score have 2x and 4x slurs; score was also edited to
make it a single long slur, but not sure which was first. Going with split for now. #UNDECIDED

mm. 100-103: Violin I is missing a f dynamic in the part that's in the score. Also, violin II and viola
have a decrescendo in 101 on the downward part of the line which is in the score, but only for trombones.
This decrescendo isn't in the parallel passage at m. 9. Adding the decrescendo for all, including flute, starting

mm. 107-110: Solo piano in the score splits a middle staff out; whoever copied the PR compressed it into two.
Sticking with the PR.
(II-solo-piano)

mm. 107-110: The breakout of horns/oboe II into 4/4, in the score, is limited to those parts only. The dotted quarters
in lower strings are left in 6/8 without a metric transition, although the PR converts everything (including those
parts) to 4/4 to keep things simple. In the parts, most of the instruments doing rests during this period wrote in
the transition to 4/4; it looks like the conductor switched to 4/4 for the benefit of the orchestra, so this
would match what they saw. The lower strings and tympani just plow through in 6/8 as though nothing interesting is
happening elsewhere.
This leads to an obvious question: why not just go 4/4 for everyone except solo piano, like the PR? Perhaps a courtesy
tempo marking [dotted quarter = half note] to make things clear. This would make it more like the 12/8 section in m.55
of the first movement.
(II-orch-*)

mm. 107-110: Horn VI should be a simple tranposistion of Horn I, but it isn't because it uses different accidents: b-flat
instead of a-sharp, for example. It might make sense to adjust Horn I to use the same accidentals as VI, and adjust Horn II
similarly so the intervals flow in parallel as you'd expect. #UNDECIDED

Horn VI:      4 4 4 8(8)4 4 | 4(4)4 8(8)4(4)| 4 4 4 4 8(8)4 | 4 4 4 4 8(8)4 | 4(4)8(8)8(8)8(8)4

The score is sketchy in slurs and which parts get them; the most attested slurs are the ones on the eighth
notes in the last bar. The recording's technical quality limits me to hearing only the top voices:

Recording:    4 4 4 8 8 4 4 | 4(4)4 8(8)4 4 | 4 4 4 4 8 8 4 | 4 4 4 4 8(8)4 | 4(4)8(8)8(8)8(8)4

I'll go with the following for now.

Consensus:    4 4 4 8(8)4 4 | 4(4)4 8(8)4 4 | 4 4 4 4 8(8)4 | 4 4 4 4 8(8)4 | 4(4)8(8)8(8)8(8)4
(III-orch-*)

mm. 14-18: The primary melody parts above have ^ accents written into most of the parts (with
Clarinets being the exception). These accents are there for the bass notes in the score, but not these
parts. Using them for now.
(III-orch-*)

m. 14: Clarinet IV and Oboe III play the same (c, fourth down from melody) notes on the first and second
beats, and have those notes slurred in parts and score. Horn parts which have the same notes don't.
Keeping slurs but will revisit. #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-02-oboes, III-orch-03-clarinets)

mm. 14-18: Horns I, III and IV all play the primary melody (with horn I having some octave changes). The III/IV
parts are written with different accidentals than I, especially in the first three bars, and the ones in
III/IV seem more reasonable. The score has the different accidentals, just as they are in the parts.
Should I adjust Horn I to match III/IV? #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-06-horns)

mm. 14-18: Something I noticed while doing the piano reduction ossia: the transfer of a bunch of parts to
the countermelody has left one of the notes in the chords a bit thin. Horn V is the only voice playing
the fifth under the melody. Anyone performing this might want to swap Horn III from copying IV/VI and
have it play in unison with V. #SPECULATION
(III-orch-06-horns)

mm. 14-18: Basses lack the ff dynamic that cellos/violas have. Added. Also, cellos show both > and ^ accents
on the strong beats; score only has ^, going with that.
(III-orch-10-cello-bass)

mm. 14-18: The "countermelody" parts (Flutes, Clarinets, Bassoons) differ in slurring. Flute inserts have
no slurs; the parts (including Piccolo) have slurs on all half-bar groupings except the last, which is scratched
out in piccolo. (The score seems to show slurring on all groups.) Clarinet II shows slurring on all groups except
the two last, which replace them with slurs between the 8 and the dotted 16 in the last bar. Bassoon I has an
overlay which scanned badly, but seems to have slurs on all groups. Bassoon II has slurs on all groups.
The parts are all but inaudible in the recording. Going with all groups slurred for now. #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-01-flutes, III-orch-03-clarinets, III-orch-04-bassoons)

mm. 14-18: All flutes have an inserted page in the part that covers these bars. Flute I in the score only
plays the first two measures, then drops out in favor of piccolo. In the rewritten part, it plays all five
bars, written down an octave but with an "8va". Flute II is written down an octave but without the "8va",
and like Flute I continues for all five bars. Flutes III and IV were originally playing the melody (as
seen above), but the inserts in the parts instead match flute II. Following the inserts.
(III-orch-01-flutes)

mm. 14-18: Interesting puzzle with the oboe parts. They all have inserts in the scan which match those of the
flutes. But there's no mark in the parts themselves saying to use the insert, like there are for the flutes.
Score matches the original parts. I think these revisions are due to the countermelody being weak in the
original scored version, and needing reinforcement. (It's barely audibile in the recording.) Following the
inserts here too.
(III-orch-02-oboes)

mm. 14-18: Bassoons I and II originally played the countermelody but only for 2 bars. Bassoon I has a patch
on the part which writes it out for all five; Bassoon II only has 2 bars, like the score. It seems reasonable
to extrapolate that II should follow in I's example; no obvious reason not to, especially since so many other
woodwind parts moved to this countermelody.
(III-orch-04-bassoons)

m. 16: Trombone I has a cis on beat two and the second half of beat 5; Trumpet I has des. These match the
score, and the matching horn parts. Leaving as is for now.
(III-orch-05-trumpets)

m. 19: Extend the 8va in the piano reduction upper staff to the downbeat of this bar. It makes more sense that
way.
(III-piano-reduction)

m. 19: The various wind instruments which had the countermelody inserted rather than in the parts don't have
the final f that starts this bar; only the second clarinet and piccolo have them, as they were the only ones doing
this figure in the original score. Does it make sense to add it to the adjusted parts? (Flutes/Oboes/Bassoons)
I'm going to go with "yes" for now. #UNDECIDED
Second question; should they land on an explicit p dynamic, like the strings, to go along with the diminuendo?
Again, going with "yes" for now. #DYNAMICS
(III-orch-*)

m. 27-30: In the PR, the solo piano bars the top voice differently in the firat two measures compared to the
second. The score has all four measures the same way the second half of the PR does. Going with that.
(III-solo-piano)

m. 34: Violin I part lacks the accents on the beats that clarinets/horns have. Adding them.
(III-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 49-53: We've reached the point where keeping Trombone I/II in tenor clef has reached diminishing returns. Flipping
back to bass here, instead of just before rehearsal 61.
(III-orch-07-trombones-tuba)

m. 54: Violin II's first note in part is c; according to score (and cues in Violin I part), it's a. Could be a copyist
error that nobody caught. Changing to a.
(III-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 56: Flute I has no dynamic in score. Part is ff, clearly by performer, not copyist. Giving it mp for now to match EH
in previous bars. #DYNAMICS
(III-orch-01-flutes)

mm. 64-67: Solo piano part is perfectly readable as written, but honestly this might be better with a third staff.
(III-solo-piano)

m. 64: Clarinet IV has an empty bar here, jumping in suddenly in m. 65 instead. The score shows it playing in this
bar, an octave below I as we'd expect from the rest of the line. No mark in the score indicating anything was changed.
Going with the score here.
(III-orch-03-clarinets)

mm. 68-73: Flute, violin I and oboe parts have accents. Violin IIand viola parts do not. No sign of them in the scores;
leaving them out for now. Flute slurs also don't match Violin I, but score shows them as different. Leaving them as is.
#UNDECIDED
(III-orch-*)

mm. 74-76: Violin I and viola have accents here, II partially, cellos/bass do not. No sign of them in the score.
Leaving out for now. #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-*)

mm. 85-87: In the piano reduction, the b that starts in 85 should clearly be b-flat based on the score. Fixed.
(III-piano-reduction)

mm. 85-89: Bassoon I and II drop into bass clef for five bars here, but jump right back to tenor. Leaving it in
tenor for now.
(III-orch-04-bassoons)

mm. 90-91: Piano reduction, in the inner voices, uses a different barring style in 90 and 91. The score and parts
use 90's barring style for both measures. Doing the same.
(III-piano-reduction)

mm. 92-94: The piano reduction goes into 4/4 for these measures, vs. the 12/8 of the solo. This seems to be pointless,
since the orchestra is silent at this point. The parts and score have 12/8 for everyone. Just leaving this as 12/8.
(III-orch-*, III-piano-reduction)

mm. 96-103: The piano reduction bars the lower staff 16th figure in two different ways: broken up in 96-99, and connected
with stuttered beams in 100-103. The orchestral parts playing that are beamed the second way in the score. Going with
that throughout.
(III-piano-reduction)

mm. 96-103: Melody parts have articulations, some of which are backed by the score, and others not. Oboes and Violin II have
staccato marks on some notes, which are in the score; Violin was missing some that oboes have, so I added those. Brass parts
have no staccato marks but ^ accents on the second beat, which aren't in the score. Leaving those out. Should revisit
this later. #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-*)

mm. 96-103: Viola part not done in a beam-through fashion in the parts, although it is in the score. Everyone else has
beam-through. Changing viola part to match.
(III-orch-09-violins-viola)

mm. 111-112: Piano reduction matches what's in the source, but the source is arguably a bit ugly and might stand some
revision at some point. #UNDECIDED
(III-piano-reduction)

m. 112, 116, 118: Why are rehearsal numbers 64 through 66 where they are? More evidence rehersal marks should be reworked.
(III-orch-*)

m. 113: Solo piano beat three-and-a-half starts with an a, as opposed to the f that starts beat one-and-a-half. Since
the two halves of the bar are otherwise identical, this is suspicious. Full score confirms f. Making it f to keep
symmetry.
(III-solo-piano)

mm. 114-117: Solo piano has four identical bars notewise, again both halves symmetric. Bar 114 has a slightly different
pattern in clefs than the other three, not changing the lower staff to bass clef just before beat three. The other bars
do that, despite the fact the copyist left out the actual clef in 116. Doing all four bars the same way.
(III-solo-piano)

mm. 114-117: Violin I part has some accents and staccato markings in the melody that are also in the score; the flute and
piccolo, who copy this line, don't have them. I've added them in to match Violin I for now. Not sure it's right. Should
revisit. Oh, and flutes/piccolo slur the beats with the grace notes slightly differently. #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-01-flutes)

mm. 118-125: This section generally has missing or inconsistant dynamics. Didn't do much thinking here. Need to come
back to this section when the dust settles and work out how this should look. #UNDECIDED #DYNAMICS
(III-orch-*)

m. 119: Viola has an e-double-sharp in beat 2, which makes no sense; score has f-natural, which would be e-sharp. PR has
f-natural. e-sharp actually might make the figure a bit more readable; cheating a bit and using that.
(III-orch-09-violins-viola)

m. 122: Solo piano, pretty sure the grace notes in beat 3 are supposed to be e fis, not e f. Changed.
(III-solo-piano)

m. 123: Piano sextuplets are 32nd in score, 16th in PR. 32nd obviously correct.
(III-solo-piano)

m. 124: Piano reduction changes the pattern suddenly in this bar, changing gis to fis. I can't see any reason to do this;
the orchestra isn't changing anything it's doing, and this passage doesn't match any particular instrument anyway. Letting
the pattern sit.
(III-piano-reduction)

m. 127: Contrabassoon got upgraded to ff in score. Using that. #DYNAMICS
(III-orch-04-bassoons)

mm. 128-129: These began life as a single 8/4 measure. This change makes some of the held notes awkwardly straddle the new
bar line, such as in the strings and upper winds. Changing them to look more like the piano reduction.
(III-orch-*)

m. 128: The bass part has the first beat tied to the rest of the bar. That first tie isn't in the score. Based on the PR,
I'm treating it with skepticism and removing it for now. #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 129: PR solo piano, in the last eighth note, breaks the pattern by changing <bes ees> to <e, bes' ees>. No sign of this extra
note in the score, and it never happens again. Suspect it's an error.
(III-solo-piano)

m. 130: Accents on beat 3 of the melody are in multiple parts and score. All clarinet parts also show an accent on beat 2, but
neither the score or any other parts have that. Keeping the one on 3 and adding it to parts that don't have it, leaving off
2 for now.
(III-orch-*)

m. 131: Some parts and score show a diminuendo on the last beat of this bar. This probably should go in, but haven't done
so yet. #DYNAMICS #UNDECIDED
(III-orch-)

m. 132: Upper cello/viola quintuplet is written a bit differently than it was transcribed in the PR. PR line uses des instead of cis.
It might make sense to adjust the cello line accordingly, maybe. Also, the Viola divisi uses c-sharp throughout, and based on the
score it should match the cello instead.
(III-orch-10-cello-bass)

m. 135: What's going on in the piano reduction here? It looks like the bar was never completed; the bass drops out despite the
fact the orchestra keeps going, and part of the rhythm in the upper staff doesn't make sense now, despite the fact the
orchestra pattern hasn't changed. Revising this bar to be more like 133-134.
(III-piano-reduction)

m. 137: Now the piano reduction changes the way the top staff lower voice is notated. It has the same rhythmic meaning as
before, and lilypond has a heck of a time making the new way look good. Just continuing to do it the way it was done before
instead.
(III-piano-reduction)

m. 138: Piano reduction loses the lower bass notes for a while. Adding them back.
(III-piano-reduction)

m. 139: Solo piano lower staff is missing a tie. It's there in score. Adding.
(III-solo-piano)
