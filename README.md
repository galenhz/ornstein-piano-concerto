# Leo Ornstein - Piano Concerto (S824)
This is a fully typset version of Leo Ornstein's Piano Concerto, written in the early 1920s and not (as far as I know)
published at the time. A manuscript score and set of parts was uploaded to IMSLP with the approval of the composer's son.

This is a work in progress, and will not be complete for some time. The material can be hard to interpret and is sometimes
contradictory. My goal is to create a defensible performing edition of the score, rather than a full critical edition;
the decisions I make as I progress are being recorded in this repository as well.
