# Leo Ornstein - Piano Concerto (S824)
This is a typeset version of Leo Ornstein's Piano Concerto, written in the
early 1920s and not (as far as I know) published at the time. A manuscript
score and set of parts were uploaded to IMSLP with the approval of the
composer's son.

My goal is to create a defensible performing edition of the score, rather than
a full critical edition, which would require a great deal more information and
time than I have.

The materials I have access to are a scans of a well-inked piano reduction,
plus a full score and set of parts, which seem to have been worked over by many
hands. It is not always easy to tell what was written in by performers as
opposed to the original author/copyist, and given the composer's sparseness
with expressive markings, it's probable that some of them should be considered
offical. I have tried to excercise my best judgement throughout, and document
my decisions.
